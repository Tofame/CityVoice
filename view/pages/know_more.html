                Thanks to the Civic Budget, residents decide how to allocate a part of [City]'s budget. Each year, [City] residents devise and submit projects, and then vote on which ones will be implemented. This way, they collectively decide what will be created in their immediate vicinity, in several districts, or throughout the entire city of [City].
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Civic Budget, every [City] resident can submit a project or vote. There's no need to be registered as a resident or be an adult. Participating in the Civic Budget is a great opportunity to decide with others how [City] changes.

                The Civic Budget is more than just allocating funds; it's a powerful tool for community engagement and local development. It empowers citizens to directly influence public spending, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for their shared urban environment. This democratic process ensures that investments truly reflect the needs and aspirations of the local population.

                Through the years, the Civic Budget has led to numerous improvements across [City], from new parks and playgrounds to cultural initiatives and infrastructure upgrades. It's a testament to the power of collective decision-making and a dynamic model for urban governance, continuously evolving with the city's needs and residents' ideas.
